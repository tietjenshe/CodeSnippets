# CodeSnippets
A collection of code snippets from previous projects

### PlayerMovement
A code snippet of a player controller from an uncontinued 2D platformer game. The controller features left/right movement, double jumping, coyote time and faster falling than jumping for improved game feel.

### Turret
The script for my turret entity from my game 'Flagship'. It tracks and shoots the player once he/she comes in range. It also tracks its health and can be destroyed. 
The entity makes use of my self-written engine as well as its components and events to define its behaviour.
